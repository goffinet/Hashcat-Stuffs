## Hashcat-Stuffs/masks/9_plus_microsoft_complexity_top_5000_masks.txt
List of the top 5,000 masks created from all publicly available password dumps, with 9+ characters, meeting Microsoft password complexity requirements (6+ characters in length, 3/4 categories: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, special characters). The collection of generated masks was sorted by a score of computational complexity versus occurrence, selecting the top 5,000 most occurring and easiest to run through. This creates mask attacks that make it through the most frequently used key-spaces, as fast as possible. It should be used after running through the entire 8-character bruteforce.
